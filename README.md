# Crunchy Python CLI
This is going to be a Crunchyroll API application written in python. This isn't going to be a big project so far. You will have to run this in a Linux or Windows command line.

## Getting Started

In order to get started git clone this project in a directory using the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Mar2ck/CrunchyPythonCLI/
```
You will need to install the packages written in the [requirements.](https://github.com/Mar2ck/CrunchyPythonCLI/blob/master/requirements.txt) After you have installed the requirements you can run the base [program.](https://github.com/Mar2ck/CrunchyPythonCLI/blob/master/src/main.py)

You should open the program with:

```
python3 main.py
```

## Prerequisites

In order to get the program running you will need to install these packages.

```
tlslite
requests
crunchyroll
youtube-dl
cfscrape
node.js
```
The Python packages can be installed with the following command (delete the "sudo" on Windows):

```
sudo pip3 install tlslite requests crunchyroll youtube-dl cfscrape
```

Node-JS is also needed and can be installed on Debian-based distros with this:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
```
